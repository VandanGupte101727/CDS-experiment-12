AIM:- To study and implement constructors and destructors<br>

Software Used:- VS code <br>

Theory:-<br>
A constructor is a member function of a class that is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created. It ensures proper initialization of the objectâ€™s data members and resources.<br>

Types of Constructors:<br>
1).Default Constructor: Takes no arguments or has default parameters. If no constructor is defined, the compiler provides a default constructor.<br>
2).Parameterized Constructor: Allows passing arguments to initialize the object with specific values.<br>
3).Copy Constructor: Used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. If not explicitly defined, the compiler generates a default one that performs a shallow copy.<br>
